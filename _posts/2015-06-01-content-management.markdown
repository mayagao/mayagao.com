Editors log on to WordPress with certain goals in mind, to publish stories, to monitor content, to increase readership, or to troubleshoot site issues.The current WP dashboard is cluttered with various irrelevant functions (quick draft, activity, WP news, etc.) and fails to provide editors easy access to their daily tasks.
<br><br>

I want to simplify the process of content creation and management, make troubleshooting and information sharing easier, and facilitate efficient content curation and promotion.
<br><br>

The current WP interface is not very intuitive. When the site structure is complex, one often has to click through a series of links to edit a certain page. The new design creates a shortcut list of most-used tasks. It is less about expanding functionality, more about creating a more efficient navigation system.

<h5>Site Analytics</h5>
Editors need be constantly aware of the analytical statistics to adjust/improve content marketing. Instead of simply listing all the stats, the new design displays only actionable data and trends

Make it easy for editors to push stories to landing pages and section fronts.
