	<p>
	I was born in a <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Zhifu,+Yantai,+Shandong,+China/@37.532671,121.4184092,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x35906366b4fb7973:0x8e0eb445e543e4ae">small beach town</a> in East China. I went to college for western philosophy, before coming to the US in 2012 for a <a href="http://newhouse.syr.edu">master’s program</a> in multimedia journalism. </p>

	<br/>
	<p>At grad school, I started a few startup projects with my friends, including a <a href="cusetogo.html">food delivery website</a>, an <a href="misc.html"> iPad tooth brushing game</a> for kids, and <a href="http://whoisinto.me">a web application</a> that can analyze people’s interactions with friends on Facebook. The need for endless iterations and constant launches allows me to learn a lot of things, from user research, visual design to prototyping, within a short period of time. I never received any systematic design education and I started learning design by just doing it. </p>
<br/>
	<p>I've always been intrigued by the challenge of finding innovative ways to present large amounts of information and data to the public. And I was lucky enough to start my career at a design agency, <a href="http://upstatement.com">Upstatement</a>, that’s exactly about tackling that challenge: they empower journalism and storytellers. I contributed to the QA and debugging process for several clients including <a href="http://nieman.harvard.edu/">Nieman Journalism Foundation</a> and <a href="http://harvardlawreview.org/">Harvard Law Review</a>. I also designed <a href="content-management.html">content management tools</a> to simplify the publishing and editing process for news organizations. I created the concept, designed the interface, and also wrote part of the front-end code. It's the first time I was designing systems that can solve problems for real people, not just web pages that’s constrained inside a browser window, and I absolutely loved it.  The most important lesson I learned while working there is to think small: instead of trying to find the perfect strategy, start from solving small, urgent problems for the users.</p>
<br/>
	<p>Right now I am a user interface designer at <a href="http://lonelyplanet.com">Lonely Planet</a>, a company that makes a variety of print and digital products for travellers. Here, I work with external clients like Delta, Budget, and JEEP to create partnership campaigns or other digital products using LP content. I am involved in all stages of the product process—from concept (Like <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/280809525/Delta.pdf">creating campaign positioning and messaging</a>) to launch—in collaboration with a global team of content producers, product managers, and engineers. In addition, I also contributed to improving the user experience of the LP website, by making small adjustments to a page or a user flow with A/B testing, or <a href="destination-pages.html">overhauling a whole system</a>. Here at LP I am surrounded by passionate people from all around the world with various culture backgrounds. I learned from them, not just design techniques, but also how to respect, listen, show empathy, and stay unique. </p>
<br/>
	<p>That’s all about me, and it has been an amazing journey so far. I think the biggest pleasure of being a designer is creating tools that can make an impact on people’s daily life. The challenging process of finding the simplest solution to problems within constraints always excites me.
