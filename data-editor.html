Each features has coordinates, geometry, and property information. With the editor, users can create different types of features (polygons, points, and lines) with the drawing tool and then add specific properties to identify and manage the features. </div>

        <div class="lh-copy f5 mb3 o-80">For the initial dataset editor release we were aming for simplicity and flexibility. The team wanted to create foundation for more complicated features down the line. We identified four main tasks users can perform inside the interface: import, draw, edit, and export. And then we validated if the design can make performing those tasks easier through user testing. There are three main design challenges we were facing: </div>

        <ol class="lh-copy pt3 mb-list f5">
          <li class="pb2"><span class="f5 dib mb1 o-80">Shared property fields</span>. <span class="">Feautures inside one dataset usually share the same set of property fields. However we don't store such information in GeoJSON files. </span></li>
<li class="pb2"><span class="f5 dib mb1">Search</span><span class="">. It was difficult to filter the dataset and find specific features. </span></li>
<li class=""><span class="f5 dib mb1">Precision</span><span class="">. Spatial data is precise and we want to give users full control when that is needed.</span> </li>

        <div class="lh-copy f5 mb3 o-80">When I first started on this project, the UI consisted of a left panel with a list of features, and a map. I spent a lot of time trying to solve the same problem Eden was trying to solve before: if we can't have common properties, then we should make it easy to share property fields when selecting multiple features.</div>

<div class="lh-copy f5 o-80">I sat down and did my first user testing with Amy Lee and she had lots of trouble finding/indetifying features. For me it's the most important user testing because at that time I focused solely on multi-select & property sharing while completely overlooked some fundamental flaws with the list design itself. Each feature in the list, for example, needs a unique identifier such as name to make the it work, but the name concept does not exit in GeoJSON. Tom suggested removing the list and multi-select completely and really simplifying the UI. Amy's user testing really convinced me that is the right thing to do. And I'm grateful we did that early on..</div>

        <div class="lh-copy f5 mb3 o-80">The second major iteration was really about simplifying and refocusing. Without the feature list panel, there's a lot more space to directly draw on the map. By removing multi-select for property edit, we can focus on refining single feature edit, which seems simple, but is actually quite hard to do well. I still had lots of concerns and doubts about the design, like how difficult it is to overview data and ensure consistency. We did one user testing with Rodolfo and he struggled a lot making sure all the property fields for all features are the same. Matthew started solving this problem by introducing typehead and then we iterated a lot on the design. In the released version users are able to add all existing property fields to one feature with one click.</div>

<div class="lh-copy mt3 f5 o-80">
         Test early and often. Sometimes the problems are so small and detailed, I would never have believed they existed if I didn't sit in room with another person and watch them struggling with it. User testing prevents me from relying too much on what have been done in the past and instead helps me focus on design practical systems that support interactions.</div>
<div class="lh-copy mt3 f5 o-80">
Gain perspectives from disagreements. I often became angry when I can't get other people to like my work or agree with my proposals and I got frustrated with those human interactions. But design is really a team team effort, especially for a complicated product with many moving parts. Arguments can often bring in new perspectives. I don't need to agree with all of them but I have to understand them. It's less about winning all the battles, and more about realizing that I can not produce the best work without the people around me.</div>
