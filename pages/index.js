            I'm passionate about making professional tools for technical
            audiences. I love to approach a project by learning a brand new
            subject, understanding its intricacies, and finding a balance
            between data and intuition.

            In 2015, I joined{" "}

              Mapbox
            </a>{" "}

              Mapbox Studio

            , a custom map design tool for cartographers and developers.
            Cartography is a combination of art and science. Trying to dissect
            its complexities was a humbling experience.

              Stripe

            in 2017 where I led the design of Runkit, an interactive JavaScript
            prototyping playground in the browser. I contributed to a wide range
            of projects there, including designing better debugging and
            prototyping experiences for engineers.{" "}

            in 2019, a visualization tool for data scientists. It was an
            exciting time at Observable where I got to define new systems for a
            product still in its nascent stage of development.
